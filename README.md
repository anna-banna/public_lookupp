# Lookupp

"Lookupp is a youth-led, community-powered nonprofit and mobile app based in Wilmington, North Carolina."

## Overview

This project is a Flutter application designed to extend the capabilities of the LookUpp platform to Android devices. The app leverages Firebase Firestore for backend services and incorporates beacon technology for innovative features. While the Swift version of the app is already in use, this project focuses on delivering a seamless Android experience, showcasing the results of extensive research and implementation of beacon technology.

The app combats legislation aimed at banning phones from classrooms by offering an innovative alternative: encouraging students to engage with their phones responsibly. When a studentâ€™s phone detects a beacon, they can join it and must lock their phone to earn points. These points can be redeemed for valuable rewards, such as coupons or shadowing experiences with local companies. This approach shifts the focus from restrictive measures to positive reinforcement, promoting a balance between technology and classroom engagement.
